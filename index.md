## Harish Aseebat

I build scientific and quantum-adjacent software that turns complex physics into interactive, usable tools.

## About

I work at the intersection of **scientific computing**, **visualization**, and **quantum workflows**. I enjoy designing end-to-end systems: UI/UX, backend orchestration, provider integrations, and data/plot pipelines.

## Highlights

- **Unified platform**: a single Trame server hosting multiple physics apps.
- **Hardware-agnostic**: local simulation + IBM Quantum + IonQ + CUDA-Q.
- **Interactive visualization**: Plotly + PyVista for time-series and 3D views.
- **Cloud-ready**: container-first deployment and single-port hosting patterns.
